\f0\fs24 \cf0 An algorithm is a set of steps for a computer to perform a specific task. Algorithm can do a variety of tasks, such as sending information to other people and arrange information. I think the best sorting algorithm is insertion sort. An example is using the list 12, 11, 13, 5, and 6. Looping through the list shows that 11 is smaller than 12, and we insert 11 before 12. When i=2, 13 stays in its position, and when i=3, 5 will move to the beginning. When i=4, 6 will move after 5, and all the other numbers will shift up. }
